* Important Information

Example of a image embed.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next figure link (or table)
#+NAME:   fig:SED-HR4049
[[../drawings/out/example.svg]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

It is reccomended to use svg embeds as it allows for zooming in as well as easily exporting to html or a pdf without having to rerender it.

To compile a .org to a .pdf:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ library/ > pandoc -s ./src/template.org -o ./tex/template.tex && pdflatex -interaction=batchmode -output-directory="./out/" ./tex/template.tex
#+END_SRC
