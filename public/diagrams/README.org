* Diagrams

Creating latex diagrams, especially with the tikz library, is extremely useful for embedding into a notebook as a diagram.

Diagrams are publically as stored here, allowing for access from any notebook.

For each diagram, it is generally reccomended to use the same file name and compile it to SVG.
To compile a .tex file to .svg run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pandoc -s input.tex o output.svg
#+END_SRC
_requires pandoc_
