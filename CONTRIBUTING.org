* Contributing
I encourage contributing, whether it just be if you find an issue with the work produced or want to add your own work to the project. I will be happy to accept any contributions. If you want to contribute, please fork the project and submit a pull request. I will review the pull request and merge it if it is acceptable. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

I still have yet to write out guidelines for pull requests.

Contributing to a book/work will add you to the author tag on the file/s modifed. You may use your real name or a preffered alias.
